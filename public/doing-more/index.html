<p>&#8220;Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn&rsquo;t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8211; Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above quote is one that my wife tends to use a lot, and for good reason. Honestly, I had never heard it until she brought it to my attention. I&rsquo;ve spent the last few days reading it over and over and realizing that there is so much more to life than sitting at my desk programming. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy programming and my job&#8230; actually I can go as far to say that I love it.</p>

<p>Just a little over 3 years ago, I left an &#8220;office&#8221; job for a &#8220;at home&#8221; job. I can&rsquo;t tell you how excited I was, just knowing I would be able to spend more time with my wife&#8230; finally be able to get a dog and put more focus on things I had been distracted from. The only problem was&#8230; I was wrong. Well I do spend more time with my wife and we did get a dog&#8230; but all I&rsquo;ve done for the past 3 years is program. I&rsquo;ve launched a few side projects but my grand and glorious plans of &#8220;doing&#8221; more has been a complete flop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions&#8230; because they tend to remind me what failure feels like. This year, instead of making a list of resolutions&#8230; I&rsquo;m making one. It&rsquo;s a pretty big one, but also one that is very very hard to fail at.</p>

<p>My 2013 New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions is to simply&#8230;. Do More.</p>

<ul>
<li>Loose <em>more</em> weight&#8230;</li>
<li>Be <em>more</em> active&#8230;*<br />
*</li>
<li>Learn to be <em>more</em> efficient&#8230;</li>
<li>Love people <em>more</em>&#8230;</li>
<li>Read <em>more</em>&#8230;</li>
<li>Spend <em>more</em> time doing the things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it&#8230; I just want this year and every year to come to be filled with more than any other year prior.</p>

<p>I want to die without a bucket list.</p>
