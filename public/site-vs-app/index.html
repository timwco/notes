    <div class="post-body js-gallery mb">
      <p>When working on proposals for new work, I often get a raised eyebrow when someone hears that a simple app can cost a lot more than a large website. They think because the app might only consist of a single page and the site hundreds that the site is somehow much harder to put together.</p>

<p>When pondering this, I came up with an analogy&#8230; condos vs cottages. A condo can house many families while a cottage is generally for a single small family. If this is true, then why is it sometimes it can cost more to have a cottage built vs having a string of condo&rsquo;s built. The answer is simple&#8230; customization my friend, customization.</p>

<p>An online/web app may be smaller in size than a large website but believe me it usually takes a lot longer to build one out, and I can almost all but guarantee that the final product will have much more custom work in it than your standard website.</p>

<p>Note, that this is not ALWAYS the case, but in my line of work more times than not this rings true.</p>
