      <title>Installing Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; for a while now and have been highly impressed. Recently, when my computer crashed and I was forced to get a new one, I was so busy that I only installed what I needed to get back up and running. This weekend, I had some free time and wanted to play with Go a little more, so I though I&amp;#8217;d share my super simple process of getting it set up. Here we &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pun+intended&#34;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching to Vim</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can see from some of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://timw.co/development-tools-updated/&#34;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;, Iâ€™ve been a Sublime Text user for along time now. I started with ST2 and have been using ST3 for about the past year. When I started teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard.com)&#34;&gt;The Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt;. I did this because it is free, open source and a great tool for new developers to use. I still stand by my choice to use this in class and push my students to use it. As a new developer one of the best skills you can learn is version control. Since Atom has tools for git and Github built right in, it helps drive the point home.&lt;/p&gt;
