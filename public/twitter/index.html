    <h1 class="post-title">How I Use Twitter</h1>
    <div class="post-body js-gallery mb">
      <p>First off, I would not consider myself to be a Twitter “power user”, but I do use Twitter a lot. The main reason I use and love twitter is because I treat it as a curated list of great content. It’s curated by people I trust, respect and have actively chosen to keep up with.</p>

<p>So, how do I actually use this service? I actually get asked this quite often by friends and students. I’ll try and break it down into the simplest form, people I follow and people I add to a list.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="following-on-twitter">Following on Twitter</h3>

<p>As of this writing, I’m currently following less than 150 people. The people who are on this list fall into one of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Family Members</li>
<li>Personal Friends</li>
<li>Close Co-Workers</li>
<li>Companies or Organizations I respect or own</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t fall into one of these categories, then you don’t get a follow. Please don’t take it personally. I probably really like you and think you have a lot of great things to say, but you are not quite “follow” status in my book. Instead, you will most likely land yourself on one of my Twitter lists.</p>

<h3 id="lists-on-twitter">Lists on Twitter</h3>

<p>I have a handful of lists on Twitter. Here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atlantians &#8211; Interesting people or places in Atlanta, GA</li>
<li>Scrantonians &#8211; Interesting people or places in Scranton, PA</li>
<li>Techies &#8211; Developers, Teachers, Designers &#8211; all things tech</li>
<li>Good Work &#8211; Pastors, Churches, Organizations &#8211; only ones I support</li>
<li>The Iron Yard &#8211; Everyone I work with</li>
<li>The Iron Yard : Students &#8211; People who have been gone to TIY</li>
</ul>

<p>That about sums it up.</p>

<p>You’ll notice, I don’t have a <em>Comedians</em>, <em>Celebrities</em> or <em>Athletes</em> category. This is mainly because I try to limit myself from going down crazy rabbit holes on the internet. Also, by only tracking people that actively have a part of my life it helps keep the content relevant to me.</p>

<p>Twitter is a great resource, just make sure you find the way to use it that makes sense for you.</p>
