    <div class="post-body js-gallery mb">
      <p>As I <a href="http://tim.getbarley.com/2791/development-tools-updated" target="_blank">mentioned</a> earlier this year, I switched back to the OS X built in terminal for my everyday coding needs. I like to keep as few programs on my computer as possible and since terminal is baked in, I just stick with it. One thing I missed was some of the customization I got when using programs such as iTerm. To combat that, I began looking around for some ways to trick out my terminal, both in appearance but also (and more importantly) in functionality.</p>

<p>First step, download and install <a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">TotalTerminal</a>. While this is technically another program, you only know it by the extra settings window under Terminal &gt; Preferences. This program adds the ability to open the terminal window from the top/bottom of your screen with a simple key command. I&rsquo;m currently using CMD + Left Arrow.</p>

<p>When it comes down to the meat of my terminal window, I have chosen to use the Zsh shell as opposed to the built in Bash shell. Added to this, I also use <a href="http://planetargon.com/who-we-are/robby-russell" target="_blank">Robby Russell</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-Zsh</a> framework which is where most customization comes in. I won&rsquo;t go into much setup here as this has already been done <a href="http://www.stevendobbelaere.be/installing-and-configuring-the-oh-my-zsh-shell/" target="_blank">many times</a> before, but it&rsquo;s fairly easy. Just install Zsh, followed by Oh-My-Zsh and start configuring the .zshrc file.</p>

<p>Here is what mine looks like:</p>

<pre># Path to your oh-my-zsh configuration.<br />ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh<br /><br /># Theme<br />ZSH_THEME="cloud"<br /><br /># Aliases<br />alias zshconfig="subl ~/.zshrc"<br />alias ohmyzsh="subl ~/.oh-my-zsh"<br /><br /># Waiting Dots<br />COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"<br /><br /># Plugins<br />plugins=(git)<br /><br />source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh</pre>

<p>As you can see, I keep things pretty simple. I use the cloud theme, have a few alias set up and am currently only using the GIT plugin. There are <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins" target="_blank">MANY other plugins</a> you can use as well.</p>

<p>There you have it, my simple terminal setup. Not too many frills, but between the key command to open terminal, and the GIT plugin to always know what branch I&rsquo;m on and if there are uncommitted changes it makes for quite a nice daily work environment.</p>
