      <p>So, I&rsquo;ve written about this before, but decided to post it up here for your (and my) sake as a reference.</p>

<p>I had a client who had a massive amount of articles on his website and by using a content aggregation (a Google nightmare), he was adding more and more by the minute. Because of the vast number of articles, he wanted a way to show his visitors the size of his site but wanted it to look a little prettier than just counting all posts. We both agreed that the best way to handle this would be to display the posts rounded to the nearest hundred, since that is most commonly what he would say in passing when someone asked him about his blog.</p>
