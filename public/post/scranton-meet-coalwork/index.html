      <p>Coworking is not a new concept at all. In fact not too long ago while working from home I was doing a ton of research for a coworking spot in this area. Unfortunately there wasn’t one… or at least one that I could be a part of.</p>

<p>You see, anyone reading this who isn’t local might not realize that Scranton (and the surrounding area) is not a very technical place. I would even say that there are not really many tech companies in the area either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PBs0tS46TlyZlmOGw7vl" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, some of the guys I work with are trying to change that. Enter <a href="http://coalwork.com">CoalWork</a>, a forthcoming coworking spot. We are still in the early stages but hope this will become a staple in city. We hope through this we’ll meet some awesome people, learn some new things and possibly even change the way this area views tech companies.</p>

<p>Anyone who is interested, feel free to check out the website or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/coalwork">CoalWork on Twitter</a>.</p>
