      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m a huge Aaron Draplin fan (&lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/p/2IAym6JGzZ/&#34;&gt;proof&lt;/a&gt;), and he was recently featured on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_649_-_aaron_draplin&#34;&gt;WTF Podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Marc Maron. It was on Designer News a week or so ago, but I finally got around to listening to it. Glad I did. Great interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_649_-_aaron_draplin&#34;&gt;the episode here&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;NSFW language&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;About 2 years ago, I took a job at a company which was about 35 minutes from my house. Having such a long commute, I started looking for other things to occupy my time in the car than just music. Enter podcasts. I was hooked right away. Since moving to Atlanta and having a 45 minute to 1.5 hour commute, I love being able to passively learn while driving (or sitting in traffic). As such, I thought I&amp;#8217;d put together a list of the Podcasts that I&amp;#8217;m &lt;em&gt;currenty&lt;/em&gt; enjoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve listed them in order of preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lore-podcast-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lorepodcast.com/&#34;&gt;Lore Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far my favorite. Generally it&amp;#8217;s a 30 minute episode released twice a month, and I seriously look forward to it. It is rooted in history and folklore, all of which I absolutly love. Aaron Mahnke has an incrible radio voice and I guarantee you will be hooked with the first episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;radiolab-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radiolab.org/&#34;&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the best science/tech podcast out there. It&amp;#8217;s not programming related, which is actually a nice change, but it does deal in new technology and how it effects our culture. I always look forward to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-american-life-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/&#34;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a podcast about, well, American life. Each episode follows a theme and contains a few different stories relvolving around said theme. It&amp;#8217;s generally an easy listen and makes the long commute go by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bad-christian-4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://badchristian.com/&#34;&gt;Bad Christian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this podcast. When I listen to it, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m hanging out with a group of my best friends. They talk about life, religion, sports and so on. They have some of the best guests around, especially since most of them are members of some of my favorite bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;criminal-5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thisiscriminal.com/&#34;&gt;Criminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast explores all aspects of the law and criminals. I find it very intriguing and it&amp;#8217;s extremely well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;javascript-jabber-6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devchat.tv/js-jabber&#34;&gt;JavaScript Jabber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had to happen sooner or later. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard&#34;&gt;teach JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; for a living. Most days, I want to avoid more coding talk, but every once in a while I want more. This podcast satifies that for me. They have great guests and are a group of extremely smart people. Highly recommended for new and seasoned programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;runner-up-8217-s&#34;&gt;Runner Up&amp;#8217;s&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are a list of ones in my podcast app, that I listen to once in a while but don&amp;#8217;t stress over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery Show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodePen Radio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shop Talk Show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial (no new episodes yet this year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break it Down with Matt Carter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing Go</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/install-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://timw.co/post/install-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; for a while now and have been highly impressed. Recently, when my computer crashed and I was forced to get a new one, I was so busy that I only installed what I needed to get back up and running. This weekend, I had some free time and wanted to play with Go a little more, so I though I&amp;#8217;d share my super simple process of getting it set up. Here we &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pun+intended&#34;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, like most tools I use on my Mac, I wanted to install Go using &lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. First step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  $ brew upgrade &amp;&amp; brew update
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    This will make sure that Homebrew is up to date and all of your packages are as well. The &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt; command isn&amp;#8217;t neccessary, but I usually do it before I install any new tool. Next up, let&amp;#8217;s install it.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  $ brew install go
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    See how easy that was. It will take a minute, but seriously that&amp;#8217;s it for the installation. Now, we just need to do some config. Navigate to your &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt; directory, for the rest of these commands.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  $ mkdir go
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The above folder is where your programs will be stored and run from. You could also use &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;golang&lt;/span&gt; or anything else. I prefer just &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s up to you. Assuming you created a directory called &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;, let&amp;#8217;s go ahead and put your Github account in there to make our lives easier later. Just replace &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; with your Github username.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  $ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/username
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Now, let&amp;#8217;s tell our computer where these files are, so we have access to the executables. Depeneing on whether you use Bash or ZSH, you will either put the folling in your &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/span&gt; or your &lt;span class=&#39;code-inline&#39;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  # Configuring Go
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Lastly, let&amp;#8217;s test it all out by installing some tools to make our lives easier. First, make sure to restart your Terminal, then run the following.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  $ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  $ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/pre&gt;
  
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That&amp;#8217;s it. Enjoy.
  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things To Do</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/todo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://timw.co/post/todo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a pretty detailed oriented person and try extremely hard to never forget to do something. When a person forgets to do something they said they would, they are not only hurting themselves but many times they are hurting the progress of someone else. I learned this early on in my marriage, and even though I still mess up, I feel like I’ve gotten a lot better at it. I’ve even been able to use the same techniques at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard.com&#34;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about software. Getting things done is mostly a mental thing, but without some great tools to help you along, it would be a lot harder. I use three programs on a daily basis aside from my calendar. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://realmacsoftware.com/clear&#34;&gt;Clear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wunderlist.com&#34;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/twhitacre/recommend&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these programs help me with a different type of &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt;, and I’ll explain each quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://realmacsoftware.com/clear&#34;&gt;Clear&lt;/a&gt; is a simple program that is very reminescient of Mac’s built in reminder app. It’s a “todo” list if you will. You add tasks to it, then either mark them complete or remove them as time goes on. You can have multiple lists and all the other goodies that come with lists. How I use it is when someone, co-worker or wife, askes me if I will do something, I put it on that list. It syncs nicely with my phone and computer so I always have those lists in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a small todo list is great, sometimes you need something a bit bigger. Something you can assign due dates to and add some simple notes to. For me, this is where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wunderlist.com/#/lists/inbox&#34;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; comes in. When a task is something that might span over a few days or needs to be done a very specific way, I add it to Wunderlist. This is also the place in my opinion for on-going tasks. For instance, I track all of my new years resolutions here. I also add birthday/anniversary ideas here. This way I always have a place to go when I need an idea. I also track “things to blog about” and “things I should do for my wife” here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/twhitacre/recommend&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;. In case you didn’t already know, I love Trello. One thing to note, I do not track tasks here, but rather projects. These projects may have tasks assinged to them, but I never add something like “buy milk” to Trello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether I want to get something done right away, add it to a list to do in the future or create a larger project out of it, these three apps help me get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Use Twitter</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://timw.co/post/twitter/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;First off, I would not consider myself to be a Twitter “power user”, but I do use Twitter a lot. The main reason I use and love twitter is because I treat it as a curated list of great content. It’s curated by people I trust, respect and have actively chosen to keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do I actually use this service? I actually get asked this quite often by friends and students. I’ll try and break it down into the simplest form, people I follow and people I add to a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;following-on-twitter&#34;&gt;Following on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, I’m currently following less than 150 people. The people who are on this list fall into one of the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family Members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close Co-Workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies or Organizations I respect or own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t fall into one of these categories, then you don’t get a follow. Please don’t take it personally. I probably really like you and think you have a lot of great things to say, but you are not quite “follow” status in my book. Instead, you will most likely land yourself on one of my Twitter lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lists-on-twitter&#34;&gt;Lists on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a handful of lists on Twitter. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atlantians &amp;#8211; Interesting people or places in Atlanta, GA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrantonians &amp;#8211; Interesting people or places in Scranton, PA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techies &amp;#8211; Developers, Teachers, Designers &amp;#8211; all things tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good Work &amp;#8211; Pastors, Churches, Organizations &amp;#8211; only ones I support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Iron Yard &amp;#8211; Everyone I work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Iron Yard : Students &amp;#8211; People who have been gone to TIY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice, I don’t have a &lt;em&gt;Comedians&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Celebrities&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Athletes&lt;/em&gt; category. This is mainly because I try to limit myself from going down crazy rabbit holes on the internet. Also, by only tracking people that actively have a part of my life it helps keep the content relevant to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a great resource, just make sure you find the way to use it that makes sense for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twenty Fifteen</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/twenty-fifteen/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://timw.co/post/twenty-fifteen/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s 2015 and I’ve not written in over 2 months. Since it’s a new year, my first post hast to be the grossly overdone “resolution” type. So, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not for resolutions, there are ALWAYS new things I want to do, learn, change and get better at. That said, here are a few things I would like to attempt to do this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;swift-go&#34;&gt;Swift &amp;amp; Go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/swift/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; simply because I have a list of iOS and Mac OS apps that I’ve wanted to build and it’s getting longer by the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukqa5gSE0ig&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, I was heavily drawn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been wanting to break away from the front end for a while and this seems like a fun opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;complex-math-functional-programming&#34;&gt;Complex Math &amp;amp; Functional Programming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with some funtional languages and of course I can do some advanced math, but neither one are something I would consider myself very skilled at. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of *really* smart people and am constantly learning new things and want to push myself even further this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;climbing-mountains&#34;&gt;Climbing Mountains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m still pretty out of shape. I’m walking a ton more for work and have stared to eat much better than I used to, but I still have a lot of work to do. For my physical goals, I want to get a bike and start biking once the weather is nice out. I also want to climb few of the Georgia mountains that are near by with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephwhitacre.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;playing-guitar&#34;&gt;Playing Guitar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I moved back in May, I’ve not played my guitars at all. In fact, I’ve sold off much of my gear that I used when I was playing live. Because of that, I need to start collecting some gear again as well as just force myself to sit down and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to write more. Mostly here, on my blog, but also in other formats. I have a lot on my mind at any given time and would love to get as much of it down as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and that’s it. Let’s see if I can pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching to Vim</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/vim/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://timw.co/post/vim/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can see from some of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://timw.co/development-tools-updated/&#34;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been a Sublime Text user for along time now. I started with ST2 and have been using ST3 for about the past year. When I started teaching at [The Iron Yard][2]. I did this because it is free, open source and a great tool for new developers to use. I still stand by my choice to use this in class and push my students to use it. As a new developer one of the best skills you can learn is version control. Since Atom has tools for git and Github built right in, it helps drive the point home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Atom is a great editor, personally for me it doesn’t stand up to Sublime. It’s possible it is just because I’ve been so engrained in it for so long, but no matter how hard I tried I could not make the complete switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the last few months. I’ve been getting nervous about the state of Sublime. Up until August of this year, there had been no updates and even then it wasn’t much. I’m not sure what the scoop is, but when you spend the majority of your time in a program you want to know it will last. I’m not convinced that it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided it was finally time to make the switch to one that will hopefully be around for a long time, Vim. You see, Vim has already been around for a long time and is built into most operating systems so anywhere I go I can start to make use of it without much configuration. This doesn’t mean that Vim isn’t configurable though. Take a look at the screenshot below, you’ll see I’ve added quite a bit to mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I love it. I find myself spending hours in it without ever leaving. I am at that point in my career where I can program for quite a while without opening a browser, especially when I write good tests. Switching to Vim has further pushed me to continue coding and testing and then debugging in my browser when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in my setup, colors, or plugins, you can see them all in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/twhitacre/.dotfiles&#34;&gt;.dotfiles repo&lt;/a&gt; on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-height: none; max-width: 100%;&#34; src=&#34;http://timw.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vimscreenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an instructor at &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard.com&#34;&gt;The Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt;, I get asked this question a lot. Here is a VERY simple breakdown of some of my thoughts on different platforms. This is by no means comprehensive, but I feel it gives a pretty solid overview of the platforms I&amp;rsquo;ve had experience with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wordpress-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.com&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides&#34;&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up and running really quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple themes to choose from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Domain Support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not very editable without paying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairly generic looking (not really a bad thing though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tumblr-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tumblr.com&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides-1&#34;&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to set up and use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple themes to choose from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom domain support&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides-1&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes not taken seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;medium-4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://medium.com/&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides-2&#34;&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely social&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides-2&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No custom domain support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one &amp;ldquo;theme&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wordpress-org-5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides-3&#34;&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides-3&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be time consuming your first time to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs (you need hosting and a domain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to manage it and keep it up to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;barley-6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://getbarley.com&#34;&gt;Barley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides-8211-spoiler-alert-i-had-a-hand-in-building-this&#34;&gt;Upsides &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;spoiler alert, I had a hand in building this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely Customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox Sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to use template tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides-4&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You still need to touch HTML if you want it customized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a higher monthly cost than some others listed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jekyll-7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;upsides-4&#34;&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hostable on Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static site, so it&amp;rsquo;s really fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downsides-5&#34;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not super easy to work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different than normal workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>On Learning</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are past the halfway mark for the first Front End class in Atlanta. We are moving fast and everyone is keeping up in an incredible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have walked through a handful of tools, libraries and frameworks. We have also spent a good amount of time talking through programming theory and best practice. One of the pieces that makes The Iron Yard stand out is that we put a large focus on learning how to learn. Let’s face it, in 12 weeks we can’t even begin to cover every library and framework and every aspect of HTML5. Let’s not forget about what’s coming in ECMAScript 6. Sure we’ve talked about it, but more importantly, we’ve talked about the fact that it’s coming and how it won’t stop there. New frameworks are coming out every week and the best way to keep up is to learn what to look for. It helps to have a broad enough understanding of the language to break it down and judge for yourself if it will be useful to you or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, we still dive pretty deep into JavaScript core. We spent a while writing vanilla JavaScript before we introduced jQuery, Underscore and a handful of other libraries. We also talked through the myriad of MV* frameworks and currently we are walking through Backbone.js. We start here because it is a library with a low barrier to entry. It helps round out the idea of JavaScript constructors and gives us a great way to organize our code for building applications. We are about a week into Backbone and each student in the class is building their own version of a blog. This might sound like a simple project to a few of you, but keep in mind that 6 weeks ago many of our students had never opened a text editor before. That, to me, is incredible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the only way this can be accomplished is because of the immersive environment that The Iron Yard provides. After all, perseverance does pay off and working hard for something you want is a great feeling. Even as the instructor of the class, I’m learning more about programming and myself with each lecture. I am falling more in love with this craft each day and glad to have a group of people along for the ride with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Perseverance</title>
      <link>http://timw.co/post/perseverance/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe Atlanta’s first Front End Engineering class is now finishing their fourth week. I think back to the dinner we had together the night before class began. Here was a group coming from all over, meeting for the first time and embarking on a twelve week journey. We all came from different backgrounds, states, and skill levels; yet we all shared a common commitment to grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any legendary journey, the most rewarding roads are also the most difficult. By the third week of class, I began to notice tired eyes and messed up hair &amp;#8211; probably the result of sleeping on campus the night before. Many became weary in their exploration, their discouragement obvious from their sighs as they stared at their monitor or the open conversation they had with me about their struggles. As much as I wanted to tell them to take a week off, I knew that reaching our destination in twelve weeks would mean pushing forward to the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we pushed forward and were rewarded with week four. Frustration melted to excitement. The concepts we had been covering were just now starting to click. Not just in programming, but in all areas of life, it is a proud moment when you invest in mastering something for a long time and it finally begins to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the students were really starting to understand what they were doing, and knowing I wanted to keep pushing them, we spent part of the fourth week doing their first group project. Students divided into three groups and I gave them a wireframe and a fairly vague project summary and sent them off running. Not only would they have to utilize all of the skills they have learned so far but find a way to use these in a team setting. Up until now all of their work has been solo. It has been incredible to see how they are all coming together, dividing up tasks and even implementing some agile development methods to get their work done. They are learning to communicate with each other and what it means to work as part of a team. They have been able to use their creativity to think outside the box and explore some things that I don’t think we would have specifically covered in a lecture. Once they finish the project they will be presenting them to the class and sharing what worked and what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been a welcome retreat from the struggles of the first three weeks. Don’t get me wrong, we still have a LOT to cover in the next eight weeks and I expect more frustration, hair pulling, and perplexing stares at their screen. The reality is that in the journey of programming, there are always moments of frustration and hitting one’s head against the wall. New tools and processes come out every day and we have to keep up. But I hope my students will join me in saying that the hard perseverance of week three met with the glory of week four is what makes being a developer so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joining the Iron Yard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the privilege over the years to work with some amazing companies and startups and am excited to bring my experiences into the classroom. For me, being able to spend my days building and talking about development is a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got into programming about 12 years ago and had to learn everything on my own. There was no Iron Yard, no online training and just a few books I could find at the library. Even then I still found that the best way to learn was to immerse myself and to actually build something. It wasn’t too long after that I developed my first app, began attending JavaScript conferences and started to feel like a part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to The Iron Yard is exciting for two reasons. First (and most importantly) it is because they are an awesome company filled with great people and amazing students. I’ve only been around campus for a week but spending time with some of the current students has been one of the best parts. Listening to stories of what they are learning, what they are struggling with and what they are planning to build has been very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it’s the south. I was born in Florida and lived the first 18 years of my life in a warmer climate and am excited to be back. Living in the north was definitely an experience and one that I won’t soon forget but from the day my wife and I got married we’ve constantly talked about moving south. In the past week, I not only sold my snow blower but also tried boiled peanuts for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to challenge you to do something crazy&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the first line in an email I received less than 1 month after the startup I was at ran into some trouble. And crazy it is, but also very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Steph and I are moving to Atlanta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to become a part of such an amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://theironyard.com/about/team/&#34;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; but also for all of the opportunity that Atlanta brings for both of us. I might write more about this in the months to come, but for now just read &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephwhitacre.com/chasing-dream/&#34;&gt;Steph&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I just want to publicly thank all of our friends and family who have been so incredibly helpful this last week. We could not do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/timwco&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/timwco&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; you know that I like to indulge once in a while. So far my drink of choice has been gin. &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/p/jkzy3AJG50/&#34;&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/a&gt; to be exact. As great as gin is, I have been told I should be drinking whiskey, at least some of the time. This includes all forms, bourbon, scotch, irish, rye and the likes. I’ll be honest, so far my favorite is rye with scotch being a close second but I have a long list to try and will hopefully be adding to the list as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even my wife is pushing me towards it by getting me the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Drink-More-Whiskey-Everything-Favorite/dp/1452109745&#34;&gt;Drink More Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; as well as some nice &lt;a href=&#34;http://buck4men.bigcartel.com/product/buck-signature-low-ball-glass&#34;&gt;low ball glasses&lt;/a&gt;, whiskey stones and everything else one might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://timw.co/whiskey&#34;&gt;my whiskey list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your feedback. Is there something obvious I’ve missed or a small craft distillery I’ve not heard of? If you have any suggestions, hit me up on twitter as I’d love to see what else is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So Many Bookmarks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to tell you this, but there is a lot of stuff on the internet. Obviously most of it is junk, but there is a lot of great content. This begs the question, “how do I consume it all” or rather, “how do I consume as much as I can that is relevant to me so I can keep up to speed in my industry”. This is not an easy task and because content and the way content is presented continually changes, you almost have no choice but to use some sort of service to help you keep up with it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is an aggregation service like &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenews.im/&#34;&gt;thenews.im&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://flyosity.com/interesting/&#34;&gt;interesting app&lt;/a&gt;, whatever your poison it still doesn’t help with things your friends, co-workers and twitter users share. You need a way to trap that content so when you have a chance to take a break you haven’t forgotten it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In walks &lt;a href=&#34;https://unmark.it&#34;&gt;Unmark&lt;/a&gt;. Many may have guessed I would talk about this eventually as I had a hand in building it, but I was part of this build because I knew the way I was saving my bookmarks was broken. Every service I used, while many were good, they still missed something. I’ve found that they just fill up with links I never visit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this situation for example: I’m sitting at my desk working and a co-worker says I should read this article. I don’t want to stop what I’m doing but is throwing it into one of these services the best idea. I’m not even sure what the article is about and not sure if I really am interested in it. This is the same for videos, code examples and any other link that is shared or I stumble upon throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, IMO is why Unmark is so awesome. Our tagline for it is ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://unmark.it&#34;&gt;The to do app for your bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;”. This means as a piece of content comes along during the day, I can simply throw it into my Unmark account. Later that night from my iPad or phone I can go through the list of marks I saved and see if they really are as good as I first thought. If they are, I can send them to be read later, or watch the video right inside of Unmark. If it is a recipe, I can look at the ingredient list and determine if I want to put in in a recipe storage app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Unmark can be used in many different ways, this is how I use it and I have found it has changed the way I view content and the content I do end up consuming is more relevant and meaningful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
