<p>About 2 years ago, I took a job at a company which was about 35 minutes from my house. Having such a long commute, I started looking for other things to occupy my time in the car than just music. Enter podcasts. I was hooked right away. Since moving to Atlanta and having a 45 minute to 1.5 hour commute, I love being able to passively learn while driving (or sitting in traffic). As such, I thought I&#8217;d put together a list of the Podcasts that I&#8217;m <em>currenty</em> enjoying.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve listed them in order of preference.</p>

<h3 id="lore-podcast-1"><a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/">Lore Podcast</a></h3>

<p>This is by far my favorite. Generally it&#8217;s a 30 minute episode released twice a month, and I seriously look forward to it. It is rooted in history and folklore, all of which I absolutly love. Aaron Mahnke has an incrible radio voice and I guarantee you will be hooked with the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="radiolab-2"><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a></h3>

<p>This is by far the best science/tech podcast out there. It&#8217;s not programming related, which is actually a nice change, but it does deal in new technology and how it effects our culture. I always look forward to this one.</p>

<h3 id="this-american-life-3"><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a></h3>

<p>This is a podcast about, well, American life. Each episode follows a theme and contains a few different stories relvolving around said theme. It&#8217;s generally an easy listen and makes the long commute go by quickly.</p>

<h3 id="bad-christian-4"><a href="http://badchristian.com/">Bad Christian</a></h3>

<p>I love this podcast. When I listen to it, I feel like I&#8217;m hanging out with a group of my best friends. They talk about life, religion, sports and so on. They have some of the best guests around, especially since most of them are members of some of my favorite bands.</p>

<h3 id="criminal-5"><a href="http://thisiscriminal.com/">Criminal</a></h3>

<p>This podcast explores all aspects of the law and criminals. I find it very intriguing and it&#8217;s extremely well done.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-jabber-6"><a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber">JavaScript Jabber</a></h3>

<p>It had to happen sooner or later. I <a href="http://theironyard">teach JavaScript</a> for a living. Most days, I want to avoid more coding talk, but every once in a while I want more. This podcast satifies that for me. They have great guests and are a group of extremely smart people. Highly recommended for new and seasoned programmers.</p>

<h3 id="runner-up-8217-s">Runner Up&#8217;s</h3>

<p>Lastly, here are a list of ones in my podcast app, that I listen to once in a while but don&#8217;t stress over.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mystery Show</li>
<li>CodePen Radio</li>
<li>Shop Talk Show</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Serial (no new episodes yet this year)</li>
<li>Smart Passive Income</li>
<li>Break it Down with Matt Carter</li>
</ul>
