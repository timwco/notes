As an instructor at [The Iron Yard][1], I get asked this question a lot. Here is a VERY simple breakdown of some of my thoughts on different platforms. This is by no means comprehensive, but I feel it gives a pretty solid overview of the platforms I've had experience with.

#### Upsides

  * Free
  * Easy to set up
  * Up and running really quick
  * Multiple themes to choose from
