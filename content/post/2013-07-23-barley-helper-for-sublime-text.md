It's no&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;that I'm a huge fan of Sublime Text and in fact most of [the team][1]&nbsp;I work with&nbsp;uses it as well. When creating [Barley templates][2], we wanted a way to make it a little easier.&nbsp;

I've never created a Sublime Text plugin before, but found it to be fairly easy, especially the nature of this one.

Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts. If you are a developer looking to create Barley templates, please [let us know][3], and hopefully this will make your life a little easier.
