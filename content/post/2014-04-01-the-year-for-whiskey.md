If you’ve followed me on [twitter][1] or [instagram][2] you know that I like to indulge once in a while. So far my drink of choice has been gin. [Plymouth Gin][3] to be exact. As great as gin is, I have been told I should be drinking whiskey, at least some of the time. This includes all forms, bourbon, scotch, irish, rye and the likes. I’ll be honest, so far my favorite is rye with scotch being a close second but I have a long list to try and will hopefully be adding to the list as time goes on.

Even my wife is pushing me towards it by getting me the book [Drink More Whiskey][4] as well as some nice [low ball glasses][5], whiskey stones and everything else one might need.

So without further ado, check out [my whiskey list][6]. 

I would love to hear your feedback. Is there something obvious I’ve missed or a small craft distillery I’ve not heard of? If you have any suggestions, hit me up on twitter as I’d love to see what else is out there.
