Well, it’s finally starting to warm up here in Northeast PA and I’m neck deep in finishing a soon to be released update to [Unmark][1] (formerly nilai.co).

I get asked quite often by friends what are the most used apps on my iPhone. I thought this would be a great place to share them.

The image below is a screenshot of my actual home screen on my iPhone 5. I’ve had it this way for probably the last 6 months and don’t plan to change anytime soon. Although with the thousands of app developers out there… that could change tomorrow.

Here is a breakdown of some of my favorite apps.

  * Photo App &#8211; [Camera Plus][3]
  * Browser &#8211; [Chrome for iOS][4]
  * Weather &#8211; [Check the Weather][5]
  * Lists &#8211; [AnyList][6]
  * Reader &#8211; [Pocket][7]
  * Pod Catcher &#8211; [Pocket Casts][8]
  * Music &#8211; [Rdio][9]
  * News &#8211; [Interesting][10]
  * Mail &#8211; Default
  * Calendar &#8211; Default

I also do keep up on some social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare and thus they landed a spot on my home screen. 

There are also many others I didn’t mention. If you have any questions or wonder what any are, feel free to hit me up on the [tweetbox][11].
