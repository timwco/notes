I consider myself luck that over the past 3 years I've been able to be a part of [Parker Hill][1] and their student ministries department. Over this last weekend I was able to take part in what is called the [30 hour fast][2]. Basically all of the students from middle school to high school raise money and awareness by giving up their right to eat for 30 hours.

Here's a clip of the highlight video:
