This summer I had the awesome opportunity to go on a trip with a group of students from [our church][1]. The trip is called iPac and last for two weeks. The first part of the trip was a serving part, where the students helped build a home for [Habitat for Humanity of Greater Birmingham][2]. The second week was spent at a camp in Panama City Beach, Florida called [BigStuf][3].

I had the privilege to join the students for the second week (yes I know&#8230; the easy part), but it was still well worth it.

This is yet just another reason as to why I love how my church does student ministry, and am so grateful to be a part of it.
