This past weekend, I had an opportunity to head to Washington DC (first time) with some friends to be part of [Move:DC][1] put on by [Invisible Children][2]. This event was part of their year long movement to bring Joseph Kony to justice&#8230; also known as [Kony 2012][1].

My wife and I have been supporting IC for the past 4 years and have been very proud to do so. For those of you who don't know, they exist to help bring restitution to those affected by the [LRA][3]. So far, they are doing a really good job. I won't go into specifics, since you can read all the updates on their website, but I'll just say that things are happening and in this dark world we live in, it's great to be a part of something that is making a difference. Even if only one life was saved ([and there have been many][4]), it would all be worth it.
