I'm Tim, a [hacker][1], [educator][2], and whiskey drinker currently living in Atlanta.

When not working on a project you can find me playing music, spending time with my [wife][3] or getting to know the city of Atlanta.

You can also find me on [Linkedin][4] and [Instagram][5] if you are into those kinds of things.
