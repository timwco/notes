I'm Tim, a <a href="http://github.com/twhitacre" target="_blank">hacker</a>, <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">educator</a>, and whiskey drinker currently living in Atlanta.

When not working on a project you can find me playing music, spending time with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com/" target="_blank">wife</a> or getting to know the city of Atlanta.
