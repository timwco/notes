I&#8217;m Tim, a <a href="http://github.com/twhitacre" target="_blank">hacker</a>, <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">educator</a>, and whiskey drinker currently living in Atlanta.

When not working on a project you can find me playing music, spending time with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com/" target="_blank">wife</a> or getting to know the city of Atlanta.

Feel free to check out my <a href="/" target="_blank">blog</a>, or some front endÂ <a href="/developer-resources" target="_blank">resources</a> I&#8217;ve put together.
