About 2 months ago, I launched a new website &#8211; <a href="http://codeandtonic.com/" target="_blank">Code & Tonic</a>. I enjoy blogging but rarely <del>get</del> make time to sit down and do it. So, I had the idea to create a simple website where I could share sites, articles and products that I find awesome but don't want to write an entire article about.

Tonight, I decided to make the code available on <a href="https://github.com/twhitacre/code-and-tonic" target="_blank">GitHub</a> Even though I took an <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/required" target="_blank">existing awesome WordPress theme</a> and turned it into a Barley theme, I still felt it might help some people who are getting started with Barley.

You can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/twhitacre/code-and-tonic" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> and download it if you'd like. As always, feed back is appreciated.
