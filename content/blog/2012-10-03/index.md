I have the privilege of co-leading the student band at [our church][2] on a weekly basis and getting to lead a group of up to 75 middle school students in worship every Sunday.

Another thing about me is I'm a gear hound&#8230; I can never seem to have enough. While I consider myself very good with our finances, I do have a week spot.

Over the last few weeks, I've been re-building my pedal board and somehow in the middle of it all, I also picked up a new guitar.

We'll start with the guitar. It's a [Ibanez Artcore AS73][3], a semi-hollow body guitar that sounds just as pretty as it looks. Since I play a variety of different types of music, I needed something that was a little less aggressive than my current guitar ([Schecter C1-Elite][4]) and I just happened to find this guitar for a steal.

After my bank account recovered from that purchase, I went back to finalizing my pedal board&#8230; for now.

I'll break it down for you based off of the signal chain (from my guitar to my amp).

  1. Korg Pitch Black Tuner &#8211; best tuner I've ever used&#8230; especially on a dark stage
  2. SHO Clone &#8211; this is similar to an EP Booster&#8230; it gives my signal a boost while preserving the sound
  3. CMATMODS Brownie &#8211; this is one of the best overdrive pedals I've ever played. I keep the drive down low and use it for less aggressive songs.
  4. Fulltone OCD &#8211; this is my second overdrive pedal and I use it for more aggressive songs. It can go from a sweet overdrive to a crushing distortion all while sounding unbelievable. I will never have a pedal board without this one.
  5. Ernie Ball Passive Volume Pedal &#8211; controls volume
  6. Boss DD5 (with external tap tempo I built myself) &#8211; I keep this on the dotted eighth note setting and tap in the tempo of the song we are playing.
  7. Boss RV5 &#8211; I'm not HUGE on reverb, but I do like this pedal a lot. I generally keep it on the modulation setting but changed it up every now and then.
  8. Lastly, I run from my RV5 to a Line 6 POD 2.0 and essentially use that as my amp. I use the Vox AC 15 setting and I've very happy with the overall sound.
