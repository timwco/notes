When ever you start a new project it's very important to have the right tools. Today, I decided to tackle one of the many projects that has been looming over my head. Before I got started, I took a step back to figure out which tools I would need. 

When doing a project around the house and realizing I need a tool that I currently don't have, it usually means a trip to Lowes and probably a lot of money. Luckily with the type of development I do, many (if not all) of the tools I need are free.

Here are a few I got to install today (though to be fair, I've used them all before&#8230; just not on this machine)

[Composer][1], [Laravel][2] & [Homebrew][3]
