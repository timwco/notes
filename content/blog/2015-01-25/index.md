Well, it’s 2015 and I’ve not written in over 2 months. Since it’s a new year, my first post hast to be the grossly overdone “resolution” type. So, here goes.

Honestly, I’m not for resolutions, there are ALWAYS new things I want to do, learn, change and get better at. That said, here are a few things I would like to attempt to do this year.

### Swift & Go

I want to learn <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Swift</a> simply because I have a list of iOS and Mac OS apps that I’ve wanted to build and it’s getting longer by the month.

After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukqa5gSE0ig" target="_blank">this video</a>, I was heavily drawn to <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a>. I’ve been wanting to break away from the front end for a while and this seems like a fun opportunity.

### Complex Math & Functional Programming

I’ve worked with some funtional languages and of course I can do some advanced math, but neither one are something I would consider myself very skilled at. I <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">work</a> with a lot of *really* smart people and am constantly learning new things and want to push myself even further this year.

### Climbing Mountains

So, I’m still pretty out of shape. I’m walking a ton more for work and have stared to eat much better than I used to, but I still have a lot of work to do. For my physical goals, I want to get a bike and start biking once the weather is nice out. I also want to climb few of the Georgia mountains that are near by with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com/" target="_blank">wife</a>.

### Playing Guitar

Since I moved back in May, I’ve not played my guitars at all. In fact, I’ve sold off much of my gear that I used when I was playing live. Because of that, I need to start collecting some gear again as well as just force myself to sit down and play.

### Writing

I also want to write more. Mostly here, on my blog, but also in other formats. I have a lot on my mind at any given time and would love to get as much of it down as possible.

… and that’s it. Let’s see if I can pull it off.
