So, now that I'm done ranting about [Godaddy][1] and all of the nonsense going on over there, I decided to focus my efforts on something more positive. Over the holiday break (I took a few days off), I decided to put the finishing touch on a website I'd been wanting to launch for some time.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-245" title="The Noise Lounge" src="http://timw.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/logo.png" alt="" width="332" height="66" />

A few months back, I reached out to some friends who share a similar interest in music but were not completely satisfied with the current sites out there. After figuring everything out and getting one of the [best web designers][2] alive to help me design a logo, I set to work on the actual meat of the site.

On Friday, December 30, I pushed the big publish button and [The Noise Lounge][3] went live.

Take a look&#8230; tell me what you think&#8230;
