Quite often, I get asked what kind of set up I have and what programs I use on a daily basis. About a year ago, I wrote a [post][1], but below is an updated list&#8230; this time I'll stick to development related programs.

Also, below you'll find some info my current hardware setup as well.

**Software**

  * [Coda 2][2] &#8211; came out in 2012 and I've been very pleased with it.
  * [Sublime Text 2][3] &#8211; even though Coda has been updated&#8230; I still turn to ST2 when I need nothing but pure speed.
  * [MAMP Pro][4] &#8211; running sites locally.
  * [Terminal][5] &#8211; I used to use iTerm&#8230; but switched back since I feel this does a good enough job on it's own. Also, I use Coda 2's terminal as well.
  * [ColorSnapper][6] &#8211; grabs colors
  * [ForkLift][7] &#8211; switched from Filezilla to ForkLift. Haven't looked back&#8230;.
  * [Chrome][8] &#8211; even though it's a browser&#8230; it's one of the best tools a developer can have in his toolbox
  * [Fireworks CS3][9]
  * [Photoshop CS6][9]

&nbsp;

**Hardware**

  * [2009 iMac][10] &#8211; 16gb Ram, 500gb Hard Drive &#8211; 2 monitors connected to it.
  * [2012 Macbook Pro 15&#8243; Retina][10] &#8211; 8gb Ram, 256gb Hard Drive
  * [iPhone 5][10] &#8211; 16gb
  * [Google Nexus 7][11] 16gb (my only non apple device &#8211; everyone should have at least one!)
