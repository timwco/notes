title: How I Use Twitter
slug: twitter
---

First off, I would not consider myself to be a Twitter “power user”, but I do use Twitter a lot. The main reason I use and love twitter is because I treat it as a curated list of great content. It’s curated by people I trust, respect and have actively chosen to keep up with.

So, how do I actually use this service? I actually get asked this quite often by friends and students. I’ll try and break it down into the simplest form, people I follow and people I add to a list.

### Following on Twitter

As of this writing, I’m currently following less than 150 people. The people who are on this list fall into one of the following categories:

  * Family Members
  * Personal Friends
  * Close Co-Workers
  * Companies or Organizations I respect or own

If you don’t fall into one of these categories, then you don’t get a follow. Please don’t take it personally. I probably really like you and think you have a lot of great things to say, but you are not quite “follow” status in my book. Instead, you will most likely land yourself on one of my Twitter lists.

### Lists on Twitter

I have a handful of lists on Twitter. Here they are:

  * Atlantians &#8211; Interesting people or places in Atlanta, GA
  * Scrantonians &#8211; Interesting people or places in Scranton, PA
  * Techies &#8211; Developers, Teachers, Designers &#8211; all things tech
  * Good Work &#8211; Pastors, Churches, Organizations &#8211; only ones I support
  * The Iron Yard &#8211; Everyone I work with
  * The Iron Yard : Students &#8211; People who have been gone to TIY

That about sums it up.

You’ll notice, I don’t have a *Comedians*, *Celebrities* or *Athletes* category. This is mainly because I try to limit myself from going down crazy rabbit holes on the internet. Also, by only tracking people that actively have a part of my life it helps keep the content relevant to me.

Twitter is a great resource, just make sure you find the way to use it that makes sense for you.
