I started working for [Plain][1] back in [May][2], but had been working on [Barley][3] since earlier this year. As with most developers, my website always gets neglected [because][4] after working all day long on client's websites, the last thing I want to do at night is work on mine.&nbsp;

Well, I finally had some time this weekend to set up my site on Barley&#8230; it took just a few hours. Going forward it will be much easier for me to continue to write and share my thoughts and possibly some code snippets here and there.&nbsp;

Also, this is my first time actually using Barley outside of my testing. I'm excited about this because it will let me feel what our users feel and allow me to focus my code on making the experience that much better.&nbsp;
